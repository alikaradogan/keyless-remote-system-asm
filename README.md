# Remote Keyless System

Remote Keyless System for STM32F407

### Development

The [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) from ST is what we are using to develop this project at current state. It is a good option since it comes with the compiler and debugger pre-installed.

##### Base structure of the project forked from [Furkan Cayci's Github Repo](https://github.com/fcayci) as a template.
